# How Does the Emission Pricing System Work

**Authors: Yanhan Lin, Dana Monzer

In recent days, how to reduce the emission in transportation has been concerned as one of the biggest issues all over the world. Many researchers have provided a lot of ideas, and the emission pricing system is the one that have been talked about most. However, it is not easy to place the pricing system into reality, since it is hard to achieve some of the idea based on current technology or achieving these need a high cost to operate. In this way, we try to give some ways that might be successful for the implementation of emission pricing system.

In general, the emissions in transportation are generally produced from three corresponds: demander, suppler and the shifting processes. To implement the emission pricing system into reality, we need to let these three corresponds know the importance of reducing emissions and understand to the pricing policy. In this way, everyone will be willing to follow the policies. Also, since it is not easy for everyone to obey the rules, we need to set some penalties as well.

However, the most important thing for the implementation is to set a reasonable policy. In the emission pricing formulation, there are three parameters that are relevant to emissions: h_i^s, the emission factors from product production at supply market i; h_ij, the emission factors from product transportation from i to j; h_j^d, the emission factors from product consumption at demand market j. To implement the pricing well, these three parameters should be set up properly, or people will not be stratified with the policy. In our opinion, how to determine these three factors will be shown as follows:
	For h_i^s and h_j^d, one of the most important factors to determine is the pollutant of goods. For different kind of goods or different weight of goods, the emission that creates will be different. For example, the emission transferring people in a total weight of 100 pounds, transferring people in a total weight of 1000 pounds, transferring coals in a total weight of 100 pounds will be not the same. Also, shifting from or to different places will create different emission. Under this circumstance, setting different factor from different product production will be important. Transferring items that can cause pollution is bound to have a higher factor. 
	As for h_ij, the determined factor is majorly from the severity of congestion. The road with more congestion will face more time staying on the road, which create more congestion. So, agency needs to investigate the congestion of each road to determine h_ij. Also, this parameter should be updated with different time periods since some roads are only congested during peak hours. Moreover, with the change of people’s selections, the congested area might be different in a short term. Thus, the h_ij in the whole network should be updated after a period, for instance changing every month.

The group of paying the emission policy will be the users, with the specific performance in paying tolls. However, it will be unfair to even the tolls to every user. In this way, how much money that different users to pay is the key of implementing the emission pricing system in practice. After discussion, we draw on the experiences from different countries or regions to create the tolling methods:
	In Singapore, because of the restricted land area, it is hard to contain too many vehicles. To prevent that, the government set up a series of restricted laws on getting the license plate. One of them is by checking the emission rate of vehicles. It is called Vehicular Emissions Scheme (VES). Under the VES, car users will qualify for an emission rebate or have to pay an emission surcharge based on different type of cars [1]. 
	In Beijing, people who drive new energy vehicle, which includes Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV), Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV), and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle, will get the great subsidy from the government. Also, most of the trucks are not allowed to drive into downtown during daytime.
	In 2008, ten northeastern states in the USA (Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont) implemented a carbon cap and trade system which will reduce their carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the power sector by 10% by 2018 in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) [2]. 

Since all these three examples direct to the emission of cars, we suggest that for different users, the standard of paying tolls should be different:
	For those whose VMT is higher than others should have a higher standard of emission fees. These can be solved in real world by detecting their VMT record to the payment in gas station.
	For those whose cars are more-polluted, should have a higher standard of emission fees. This can be checked by the car’s performance, especially in emission.
	For those whose cars are more often appeared in congested road, should have a higher standard of emission fees. In congestion road, we set a camera to detect the car plate that show up in congested period and trace to its users to increase their fees.

Or, agency can set a limit policy on the monthly emissions of cars. By detecting its car performance and VMT record, the car users can use their car no more than the limits. If the car is overused, users will receive an extra fee on extra emission. This will be like a form of a long-term parking fee. In congested area, agency can set the limit times of getting through from it.

That’s our thoughts about the implementation of setting emission pricing system in practice. Although some of them are still a little idealist, this way of thinking might be a good direction to make the implementation in the future.
