## Case Study: The Cheonggyecheon Restoration Project.
### Authors: Dana Monzer, Yanhan Lin

Seoul city, the capital city of South Korea, teared down a highway and restored the Cheonggyecheon river, between 2003 and 2006. [1] The elevated busy highway, that was burying Cheonggyecheon river, was transformed into a multifunctional cultural linear park around the river. 
Early in the 20Th century, Seoul was a home for millions of residents, and the river was used as a dumping ground, which made it polluted and it was decided to cover it up and build a freeway over it in the 1950s, then in 1976, the four-lane elevated Cheonggyecheon Freeway was already thought of as a symbol of successful modernization of Korea.
However, tearing the highway led to many benefits [2]. It increased overall biodiversity by reviving the river, reduced the urban heat island effect up to 4.5%, decreased air pollution up to 10.3%, improved public transit ridership up to 15.1%  in buses and up to 3.3% in subway and improved the downtown quality of life as it increased economic development in the surrounding area as it became a touristic spot attracting 64,000 visitors daily, reconnected the two previously divided parts of the city, reduced in vehicle volume about 45%, and increased pedestrian activity up to 76%. Moreover, tearing the highway that carried 168,000 cars a day didn’t slow down traffic as would be believed, but was expected to improve travel times in downtown Seoul as reported by the transportation planner of the project Dr. Hwang [1]. 
 The science behind the traffic improvements following the tear up of a highway that carried a big percentage of the daily traffic in Seoul can be simply explained. First of all, the authority at Seoul invested in other modes alternatives such as a dedicated bus lane to improve the performance of buses and subways and part of the transportation demand was diverted to transit, where the rest of the demand was diverted to a four-lane street nearby and the parallel roadways that surrounded the freeway and surrounded the 3.6 mile stream, and to other streets. 
So, the tear up of the freeway, helped users notice the other alternatives provided so they can reach their destinations, whether through other modes or other routes that include smaller roadways. These alternatives can be more successful than using a route that includes a 4-lane freeway for simple reasons: everyone will mistakenly make the same assumption that the freeway will be faster to traverse, and it will reduce one’s travel time between their origin and destination point. However, with every user seeking their own benefit, the freeway ends up being overused. And even though the freeway has high capacity to carry the current traffic, it is connected to other roadways that don’t have the same capacity, and these roadways that the freeway leads to may end up being congested or slower to traverse than other routes that don’t include the freeway at all, but with the presence of the freeway were overlooked by users. 
So, the tearing of the freeway freed concentration on using only limited routes connected to the freeway, to opening the eyes of users on the other alternatives in the city that can be as fast demand is evenly distributed, and this is exactly what was prohibited by the freeya as demand was instead concentrated on the freeway and the roadways connected to it. 
So while traffic had many other alternatives to traverse, that can even reduce the total travel time of users, where less users will traverse each roadways because of the distribution of cars on more roadways than before, and when the volume of cars on the roadways is decreased, there is less risk of congestion and the travel time of each car on a route will not be slowed down because of other cars, the freeway can be then teared and have the city enjoy the other benefits of the unique Cheonggyecheon river that the freeway was covering.
